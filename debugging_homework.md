Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
The purpose of a breakpoint is when you set a breakpoint, you run the debug, the program will
stop at the breakpoint and show the variables at that line.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
Click "Step into" icon.

4. What does the step into command do?
It will lead you into the next line or the function/method.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
We can evaluate the java expression, when we input the java expression in the Expression
window and click the "Evaluate" button, it will show the result in the Result window.
While "evaluate code fragment" means we can add some java code temporary in the "Code fragment" window and "Evaluate" the Result.
